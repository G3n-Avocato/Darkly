Buffer overflow is considered as critical security vulnerability.
    It's appen when a program attempts to put more data in a buffer than it can hold.
    Writing outside the bounds of a block of allocated memory can corrupt data, crash program, or exec malicious code.
CWE 788 Access of Memory Location After End of Buffer.

How to find the flag:
* Go to the survey page
* Choose and inspect a survey grade field with the console <select name="valeur" onchange="javascript:this.form.submit();">
-> Here we understand that the value is submitted to the form on change
* Modify the html to cause an overflow of the grade input <option value="1">99999999999999999999999</option>
-> Select the grade "1" and it's done!

Risks:

* Allows an attacker to execute malicious code or manipulate data, overflow is used for: SQL injection, data corruption,
* 
How to avoid:

* Validate and clean up all users input before using it in code (especially when numeric).
* Use libraries and frameworks that automatically manage certain overflow protections.
* Perform security tests regularly to identify and correct potential vulnerabilities with updates.
