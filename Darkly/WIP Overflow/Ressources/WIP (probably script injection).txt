How to find the flag:
* Go to the survey page
* Choose and inspect a survey grade field with the console <select name="valeur" onchange="javascript:this.form.submit();">
-> Here we understand that the value is submitted to the form on change
* Modify the html to cause an overflow of the grade input <option value="1">99999999999999999999999</option>
-> Select the grade "1" and it's done!
